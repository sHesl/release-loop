# release-loop
Answering the question of if there is a limit to the number of files in a single release, one file at a time...

The loop.yaml workflow file will continually edit the 'loop' release by adding new files. If there are any undocumented restrictions to either the number of files allowed in a single release, or the number of times you can edit an existing release, this repo hopes to discover it.
